#angular requirejs with gulp

Super simple angularjs, requirejs, gulpjs seed that uses jade and coffeescript and provides a connect static server with livereload.

gulp js is used to provide build tasks for jade, less and coffeescript whilst also handling asset publishing and the maintaining of a livereload connect static server.

##install
It is assumed that you already have `npm`, `gulp` and `bower` installed.
	
1. clone the repo

			git clone https://github.com/jh3y/angular-require-gulp-seed.git	

2. install node dependencies

			npm install

3. install bower dependencies (essentially grabbing requirejs, angular and jquery)

			bower install

4. run gulp

			gulp
			

####That's it!
